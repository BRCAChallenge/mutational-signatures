TCGA VCF file Subset into breast, ovarian, colo-rectal:

Rows:
    If chrom in range of genes in pathway
    If pos in range of genes in pathway
        Include the row in new file
Cols:
    Use GDC website to make a map file to translate from TCGA ID to Tissue type
    If tissue is x, use map file to filter out columns by tissue x.
        Include the desired columns in the new file



File indexed by individual, including TCGA-ID, Chrom, Pos, Ref, Alt, Genotype Info:

    Loop through columns in product of above tissue type subset
        If genotype is not an empty field
            Add a row of TCGA-ID (from column), and also Chrom, Pos, Ref, Alt, Genotype Info to a new file



File with set of unique variants

    Loop through rows in product of above tissue type subset
        If chrom, pos, ref, and alt (combination of them all) are unique
            Add row to new file


Purpose of these files:
Subset - to cut down the VCF to a smaller size (more manageable)
Indexed by individual -  so that it is easier to put the data together to ask: how many variants or lof mutations does this individual have, and do they overlap or can we tell that they are on opposite strands?
does this individual have two LOF variants/mutations that (knockout two different LOF variants, each knockout the same copy of the gene)
File with unique set of variants - to be able to run the variants through cravat or BaysDel in order to annotate them (pinpoint LOF mutations in order to analyze by individual)


First subset into three different sample groups by tissue type
Then use the unique set of variants as a way to run everything through cravat or bayesdel.
That way we will have annotated variants, to identify LOF
From there we can analyze variants per individual and group them into categories (those who have per gene 0 LOF, 1 LOF, 2 LOF on same copy of gene, 2 LOF one on each copy of the gene)
